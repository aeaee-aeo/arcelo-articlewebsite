            Celebrating their tenth anniversary, BTS, the globally renowned K-pop group, 
            released their first official biography, <i>Beyond the Story.</i> The book offers an 
            intimate look at their journey to becoming international superstars in an 
            intensely competitive industry. Initially rumored to be a Taylor Swift autobiography, 
            the book became a bestseller even before its subject was revealed, coinciding with BTS’s 
            hiatus for mandatory Korean military service and their decade-long career milestone.
            <br><br>
            Co-written by South Korean journalist Kang Myeong-seok and BTS’s seven members—<b>RM, 
            J-Hope, Suga, Jin, Jimin, V, and Jungkook</b>—the 544-page biography uses an oral history format. 
            It traces their rise from nervous trainees to global icons, culminating with the release of their 
            anthology album Proof in 2022. Through personal stories, the members reveal their insecurities, 
            motivations, and the grueling effort required to succeed in K-pop's demanding culture.

            The book recounts how seven teenagers from diverse backgrounds bonded in a shared bunkhouse 
            while training to become a cohesive and professional group. It also delves into their musical 
            evolution, from their roots in American hip-hop to their signature upbeat pop hits like <i>Boy With 
            Luv and Dynamite.</i> These influences brought a looseness to their choreography, contrasting with 
            K-pop’s typical razor-sharp synchronization, and allowed their individuality to shine.
            <br><br>
            Challenging stereotypes of K-pop artists as overly managed performers, <i>Beyond the Story</i> highlights 
            BTS’s active role in styling, choreography, and songwriting. The members also share how they used 
            their platform to address social and political issues, further breaking the mold of conventional 
            idol expectations.
            <br><br>
            The biography emphasizes BTS’s underdog story. Debuting under the then-small label Big Hit 
            Entertainment, the group faced skepticism and ridicule. Undeterred, they embraced DIY promotions, 
            blogging directly to fans and fostering an authentic connection that became a cornerstone of their success.
            <br><br>
            Through their journey, BTS has not only redefined K-pop but also inspired newer groups 
            like Le Sserafim and Tomorrow X Together to merge polished performances with personal storytelling. 
            <i>Beyond the Story</i> captures both their legacy and the broader evolution of K-pop, offering an insightful narrative for fans and newcomers alike.
