            K-pop group <b>Seventeen</b> has made history as the first K-pop artist to be named <b>UNESCO's 
            Goodwill Ambassador for Youth.</b> The group officially received this honor during a ceremony 
            at UNESCO's headquarters in Paris, where they delivered a heartfelt acceptance speech.  

            <br><br><b>Joshua</b>, a Los Angeles-born member, spoke on behalf of the group, expressing their gratitude 
            and emphasizing their commitment to empowering young people. He noted that their music reflects

            As part of their role, Seventeen announced they would donate $1 million to the <i>"Global Youth 
            Grant Scheme,"</i> a joint initiative with UNESCO to support educational opportunities for young 
            people worldwide. This effort is a continuation of their #GoingTogether campaign, launched in 
            2022, which aims to highlight the importance of education and foster global participation in 
            educational activities.
            
            <br><br>Seventeen’s agency, Pledis Entertainment, highlighted the group’s global influence 
            and their consistent message of resilience and growth, communicated through their music. 
            The group has previously supported educational initiatives, such as establishing two 
            community learning centers in East Timor in collaboration with the Korean National Commission for UNESCO.

            <br><br>Since their debut in 2015 with the EP <i>17 Carat</i>, Seventeen has achieved global 
            success, with hit songs like "Very Nice" and "Don't Wanna Cry." Their latest album, <i>17 IS 
            RIGHT HERE</i>, released in April, sold over 2.9 million copies in its first week and debuted 
            at No. 5 on the Billboard 200 chart.
            
            <br><br>Through their new role, Seventeen aims to inspire youth worldwide, emphasizing the 
            importance of companionship and collective action to build supportive global communities.
